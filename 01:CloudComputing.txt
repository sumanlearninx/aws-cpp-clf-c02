Problems with traditional IT approach:
--------------------------------------

1. Pay for the rent of data centers
2. Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance
3. Adding and replacing hardware takes time
4. Scaling is limited
5. Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
6. How to deal with disasters

Cloud Computing
----------------
On-demand delievery of IT resources with pay-as-you-go pricing
E.g: Gmail, Dropbox

Deployment models of the Cloud:
-------------------------------

1. Private Cloud : Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to public

2. Public Cloud : Cloud resources owned and operated by a 
                    3rd party cloud service provider delievered over the internet

3. Hybrid Cloud : Keep some services on-premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud


5 Characteristics of Cloud Computing:
-------------------------------------

1. On demand self service : Users can provision resources and use them without the human
intervention from the service provider

2. Broad network access: Resources available all over the network and can be accessed by
diverse client platforms

3. Multi-tenancy and resource pooling: Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure
and application

4. Rapid elasticity and scalability : Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources
when needed

5. Measured Service : Pay for what you use


6 Advantages of Cloud Computing:
-------------------------------

1. Trade Capital Expense (CAPEX) for Operational Expense (OPEX)

2. Benefit from the massive economies of scale

3. Stop guessing capacity

4. Increase speed and agility

5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers

6. Go global in minutes


Problems solved by cloud:
--------------------------

1. Flexibility
2. Cost-effectiveness
3. Scalability
4. Elasticity
5. High availability and fault tolerance
6. Agility


Types of cloud computing (Service models of the cloud):
-----------------------------------------------------
On- Premises:

    You need to manage : 
        Infrastructure, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking 


1. Infrasctructure as a serice (IaaS):

    You need to manage : 
        Infrastructure, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S

    AWS manages : 
        Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking

2. Platform as a service (PaaS)

    You need to manage:
        Applications, Data

    AWS Manages : 
        Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking

3. Software as a service (SaaS)

    You don't need to manage anything
    Everything is managed by AWS


Pricing of the cloud :
----------------------

1. Compute : Pay for compute time
2. Storage : Pay for data stored in the cloud
3. Data transfer out of the cloud : Data transfer IN is free


AWS Global Infrastructure :
--------------------------

1. AWS regions : Geographical area 
2. AWS availability zones : Isolated part of AWS regions having discrete data centers
3. AWS Data centers : Physical location where the data resides
4. AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence : Content is delievered to end users with low latency

How to choose AWS region?
-------------------------

1. Compliance : Data governance and legal requirements
2. Proximity to customers : Reduced latency
3. Avaiable services within a region
4. Pricing 


Shared Responsibility Model:
--------------------------

Customer : Responsibility for the security IN the Cloud
AWS : Responsibility for the security OF the cloud 


AWS Acceptable Use Policy:
------------------------

1. No illegal, harmful or offensive use of Content
2. No security violations 
3. No network abuse 
4. No email or other message abuse
