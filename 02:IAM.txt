- Users are people within your organization and also can be grouped
- Groups only contains users, not other Groups
- Users don't have to belong to a group and a user can belong to multiple Groups

IAM : Permissions 
----------------

- Users or groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies 
- Policies define the permissions of the users 
- In AWs, you apply the Least Privilege Principle. 
- Don't give more permissions than a user needs

IAM : Policies
-------------

- Version: Policy language version, always "2012-10-17"
- Id: Identifier of the policy 
- Statement: One or more individual statements
    - sid: identifier of the statement
    - effect: whether the statement allows or denies access 
    - principal: account/user/role to which the policy is applied to 
    - action: list of actions, policy allows or denies 
    - resource: list of resources to which the action is applied to
    - condition: conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional) 

IAM : Password Policy
--------------------

- Strong Passwords : 
        Set minimum password length
        Require specific character types 
        Allow all IAM users to change their password 
        Require users to change password after certain time 
        Prevent password reuse 

IAM : MFA (Multi Factor Authentication)
----------------------------------

- Protect root account and IAM users
- IAM = Paaword you know + Security Device you own 

MFA Devices:
    1. Virtual MFA Device : Google Authenticator, Authy 
    2. Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) security key : E.g: Yubikey by Yubico (3rd party). Like a pendrive 
    3. Hardware Key Fob MFA Device 
    4. Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS Gov Xloud (US)

AWS Access Keys
---------------

To access AWS, you have 3 options:

1. AWS Management Console (protected by password + MFA)

2. AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) : protected by access Keys

3. AWS Software Development Kit (SDK) : set of libraries. protected by access keys 

- Users manage their own access keys 

- Access Keys : Access Key ID (username) , Secret Access Key (password)

AWS CLI
-------

Tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command line shell 

AWS SDK
------

- Language specific APIs (set of libraries)
- Access and manage AWS services programatically 
- Emebedded within your application 

AWS Cloudshell
----------

- Terminal in the cloud of AWS
- Not available in all the AWS regions 

IAM Roles
-------

- Assign permissions to AWS services 
- Common roles : Ec2 Instance Roles, Lambda Function Roles, Roles for CloudFormation

IAM Security Tools
---------------

1. IAM Credentials Report (account-level) : Report that lists all your account's users and the 
status of their various credentials 

2. IAM Access Advisor (user-level) : Shows the service permissions granted to a user
and when those services were last accesses


Shared Responsibility Model
-------------------------

AWS : Infrastructure, Configuration and vulnerability analysis, Compliance Validation
You : Users, groups and roles management. Enable MFA. Rotate all keys often. Use IAM tools. 
        Analyze access patterns and review permissions
