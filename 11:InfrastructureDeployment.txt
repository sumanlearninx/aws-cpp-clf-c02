Deployments and managing Inrastructure at scale

1. CloudFormation
----------

- Declarative way of outlining your AWS infrastructure
- CloudFormation creates the template for you in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify

Benefits of AWS CloudFormation:
    - Infrastructure as code
    - Cost
    - Productivity 
    - Don't re-invent the wheel - leverage existing templates on the web
    - Support (almost) all AWS resources

Cloud Formation + Infrastructure Composer : We can see all the resources and relations between components visuall 


2. CDK
-----

- AWS Cloud Development Kit
- Define your cloud infrastructure using a familiar language
- Code is compiled into CloudFormation template 
- You can deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together


3. AWS Elastic Beanstalk
-----------------

- Developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Its free but pay for underlying resources
- It is a managed service
- Just the application code is the responsibility of the developer

3 architectures models:
    i. Single instance deployment - good for dev
    ii. LB + ASG - great for production or pre-production web app
    iii. ASG only - great for non-web apps in production

- Health monitoring : Health agent pushes metrics to CloudWatch. Checks for app health, publishes 
    health events


4. AWS Code Deploy
----------------

- Deploy our application automatically
- Works with EC2 instances
- Works with on-premise servers


5. Code Commit
---------

- From July 25, 2024 - discontinued by AWS
- So, recommend to use Github, Gitlab, git 3rd party
- It was the code repository : Version control, collaboration

6. AWS Code Build
----------

- Compiles source code, run tests, and produces packages that are ready to be developed
- Fully managed, serverless


7. AWS Code Pipeline
-------------

- Orchestrate the different steps to have the code automatically pushed to production
    Code > Build > Test > Provision > Deploy

- Basis for CICD (Continuous Integration Continuous Delievery)


8. AWS Code Artifact
---------------

- Store and retrieve dependencies of S/W packages


9. AWS Systems Manager (SSM)
--------------------

- Helps you manage your EC2 and on-premises (Hybrid AWS service) systems at scale
- Features:
    - Patching automation for enhanced compliance
    - Run commands across an entire fleet of servers

- Run commands, patch and configure our servers


10. SSM Session Manager
-----------------

- Start secure shell on your EC2 and on-premises services 
- No SSH access, bastion hosts, or SSH keys needed
- No port 22 needed (better security)

11. SSM Parameter Store
--------------

- Secure storage for configuration and secrets like passwords, API Keys
