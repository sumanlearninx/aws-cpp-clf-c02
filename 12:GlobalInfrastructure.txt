AWS Global Infrastructure


1. Global Application
---------------

- Application deployed in multiple geographies
- On AWS : This could be regions or edge locations
- Decreased latency
- Disaster Recovery
- Attack Protection 

* Regions - Geographical area
* Availability Zones - isolated part of regions. have concrete data centers
* Edge Locations (Points of presence) - Content delievery as close as possible to users 

Global DNS : Route53
Global Content Delievery Network (CDN) : CloudFront
S3 Transfer Acceleration
AWS Global Accelerator 


2. Amazon Route53
--------------

- Managed DNS (Domain Name System)

Route53 Routing Policies:
    i. Simple Routing Poliy - No health checks 
    ii. Weighted Routing Policy - Distribute traffic across multiple instances 
    iii. Latency Routing Policy - Redirect users to near server 
    iv. Failover Routing Policy - Disaster Recovery - use of failover instance if primary instance fails

- Domain Registration, DNS, Health Checks, Routing Policy 


3. AWS CloudFront
--------------

- Content Delievery Network (CDN)
- Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge locations 
- DDOS Protection because worldwide integration with AWS Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall

CloudFront Origins:
    i. S3 Buckets
        - Distributing files and caching them at edge 
        - Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)
    
    ii. Custom Origin (HTTP):
        - Application Load Balancer 
        - EC2 instance 
        - S3 static website

CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication:
    i. CloudFront
        - Great for static content that must be available everywhere
        - Files are cached 
    
    ii. S3 Cross Region Replication:
        - Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions 
        - Files are updated in real time
        - Read only 

4. S3 Transfer Acceleration
-----------------------

- Increase the transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location which will forward the 
    data to S3 bucket in the target region 


5. AWS Global Accelerator
----------------------

- Improves global application availability and performance using the AWS global networking
- 2 Anycast IP are created for your application and traffic is sent through edge locations 

AWS Global Accelerator vs AWS CloudFront:
    i. AWS Global Accelerator 
        - No caching
        - Proxying packets 
    
    ii. CloudFront
        - CDN 
        - Content is cached which is served at the edge


6. AWS Outposts
-----------

- AWS outposts are "serverracks" that offers the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs and tools
    to build your own-applications on-premises just as in the cloud 
- Outposts racks will be setup by AWS within your on-premise infrastrucuture 


7. AWS Wavelength
------------

- Wavelength zones are the infrastructure deployments embedded within the telecommunication 
    providers datacenters at the edge of the 5G networks 
- Ultra low latency applications 


8. AWS Local Zones 
--------------

- Places AWS compute, storage, database and other selected AWS services closer to end users 
- Extend your VPC to more locations - extension of an AWS region 


9. Global Application Architecture 
-------------------

* Single Region, Single AZ 
    - No High Availability 
    - No Global Latency 
    - Low Difficulty 

* Single Region, Multi AZ
    - High Availabilty 
    - No Global Latency 
    - Comparitively more difficulty 

* Multi Region, Active-Passive 
    - multi regions but read-write can be done in only active regions
    - in passive region, only read can be done 
    - Increase Global Read Latency
    - No global Write Latency 
    - Comparitively more difficulty

* Multi Region, Active-Active
    - Read write in both regions 
    - Increase Read Latency 
    _ Increase Write Latency 
    - Most Difficulty
