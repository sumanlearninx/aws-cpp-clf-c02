EC2 Options

EC2 Instance types
-----------------

1. General Purpose: 
    - Good balance between Compute, memory and networking
    - Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories 

2. Compute optimized:
    - Great for compute intensive tasks that require high performance processors 
    - E.g: batch processing workloads, media transcoding, high performance web servers/computing,
            scientific modelling and ML, dedicated gaming servers 
        
3. Memory optimized:
    - Fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory 
    - Use cases : High performance DB, distributed web scale cache stores, in-memory db,
                    real-time processing of big unstructured data 

4. Storage Optimized:
    - Great for storage intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to 
        large datasets on local storage 
    - Use cases : OLTP systems, relational and NoSQL db, cache for in-memory dbs, data warehousing,
                    distributed file systems 


Security Groups
-------------

- Control how traffic is allowed into or out of EC2 instances 
- Contain only ALLOW rules 
- It is good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access 

Note : 
    - If your application is not accessible (time out), then it's a security group issue
    - If your application gives a "connection refused" error, then it is an application error
        it's not launched 

Note :
    - By default all inbound traffic is blocked and all outbound traffic is authorised 

Classic Ports to Know 
-------------------

22 - SSH (secured shell) - log into linux instance 
21 - FTP - upload files into file share 
22 - SFTP - upload files using SSH 
80 - HTTP - access unsecured websites 
443 - HTTPS - access secured websites 
3389 - RDP - remote desktop protocol - Log into a windows instance 


EC2 instance connect
----------------

securely connect to EC2 instance using SSH without the need to manage access keys 


EC2 Instance Roles
----------------

Assign permissions to EC2 service
